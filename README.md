# Text Synthesizer

## Setup

Optional, but recommended: Create a virtual environment, for example with [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success#miniconda)

```
# create environment
conda create -n textsynthesizer python=3.10
# activate environment
conda activate textsynthesizer
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```
gradio app.py # for hot reloading if file modified
# alternative just with python
python app.py
```
